## This sets up your DESeq2 object for further data analysis
## This is the C42B cell line treated with different mono/bi-therapies

## Load the raw count matrices, two in this case

## Load metadata (sample annotation file)

## Checking distribution of counts per sample

  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  facet_wrap(~ sample) # looks ok

# Checking size factors and dispersion

sizeFactors(dds) # only takes into account the sequencing depth, looks ok
plotDispEsts(dds) # verifies normalization, graph looks a-ok

# Checking PCA

rld = vst(dds)

  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = 'PCA per treatment')

# Checking sample similarity

colnames(sampleDistMatrix) <- paste(rld$Treatment, sep="-")
colors <- colorRampPalette(rev(brewer.pal(9, "Blues")) )(255)

pheatmap(sampleDistMatrix,
         clustering_distance_rows=sampleDists,
         clustering_distance_cols=sampleDists,
         col=colors)

# you can see one of the day9 is clustering with day5
# but the pca shows that very little of the variance is explained
# by the length of Ola treatment so it makes sense that they are similar
# enough to cluster together when computing euclidian distances

## Saving the DESeq object

saveRDS(dds, "./data_output/C42B_DESeq_comp_to_DMSO.Rds")
saveRDS(dds1, "./data_output/C42B_DESeq_comp_to_AbiOla.Rds")
saveRDS(dds2, "./data_output/C42B_DESeq_comp_to_EnzTala.Rds")
